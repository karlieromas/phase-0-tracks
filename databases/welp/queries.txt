1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
	Command : SELECT * FROM users, reviews, businesses WHERE users.id = reviews.user_id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
	Output: 1|Bradford|Pitt|1|4|great food|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow
		2|Mandy|Kaling|2|3.5|burger was ok|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
		3|Angela|Jolie|3|5|excellent service!|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
	Command : SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses INNER JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
	Output: Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow|4|great food
		Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|3.5|burger was ok
		Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow|5|excellent service!

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
	Command : SELECT * FROM users, reviews, businesses  WHERE reviews.businesses_id = 1 AND reviews.businesses_id = businesses.id AND users.id = reviews.user_id;
	Output: 1|Bradford|Pitt|1|4|great food|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow
		3|Angela|Jolie|3|5|excellent service!|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow
