1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
	Command : SELECT * FROM books;
	Output: 1|LA Candy|259|true|1
		2|Lullaby|300|false|1
		3|Royal Raven|15|true|1
		4|Scar Tissue|648|false|2
		5|Buffalo Creek Disaster|295|false|2

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	Command : UPDATE books SET for_children="true" WHERE title="Buffalo Creek Disaster";
		  SELECT * FROM books;
	Output: 1|LA Candy|259|true|1
		2|Lullaby|300|false|1
		3|Royal Raven|15|true|1
		4|Scar Tissue|648|false|2
		5|Buffalo Creek Disaster|295|true|2

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
	Command : SELECT * FROM books, genres WHERE books.genre_id = genres.id;
	Output: 1|LA Candy|259|true|1|1|fiction
		2|Lullaby|300|false|1|1|fiction
		3|Royal Raven|15|true|1|1|fiction
		4|Scar Tissue|648|false|2|2|non-fiction
		5|Buffalo Creek Disaster|295|true|2|2|non-fiction

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
	Command : books.title, genres.genre_type FROM books JOIN genres ON books.genre_id = genres.id;
	Output: LA Candy|fiction
		Lullaby|fiction
		Royal Raven|fiction
		Scar Tissue|non-fiction
		Buffalo Creek Disaster|non-fiction

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	Command : DELETE FROM books WHERE title="Lullaby";
		  SELECT * FROM books;
	Output: 1|LA Candy|259|true|1
		3|Royal Raven|15|true|1
		4|Scar Tissue|648|false|2
		5|Buffalo Creek Disaster|295|true|2

RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN- RELEASE 3:

1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?
	- There are inner joins, left (outer) joins, right (outer) joins, and full (outer) joins. An inner join returns records that have matching values in both tables. A left join is when it returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. A right join is when it returns all records from the right table and the matched ones from the left. And finally, a full join is the case in which it returns all records where there is a match in the left or right tables. You can apply different conditions to these joins to change what is displayed to you.

2. Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.
	
	COMMAND: SELECT total_pages FROM books LEFT JOIN genres ON books.total_pages = genres.genre_type;

	OUTPUT: 259
		15
		648
		295

	COMMAND: SELECT * FROM genres, books WHERE genres.id = books.genre_id;

	OUTPUT: 1|fiction|1|LA Candy|259|true|1
		1|fiction|3|Royal Raven|15|true|1
		2|non-fiction|4|Scar Tissue|648|false|2
		2|non-fiction|5|Buffalo Creek Disaster|295|true|2

	COMMAND: SELECT * FROM books, genres WHERE books.for_children = genres.id;
	OUTPUT: nothing
