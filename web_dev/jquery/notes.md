Release 0 - Make a Plan

- google with detail to find a good resource on jQuery
- forums will be helpful
- do we need to downloan jQuery?
- test my work after each update
- to me, breaks are extremely important. If i stare at something too long I will get burned out and not retain info- take a few minute break every 25 minutes
